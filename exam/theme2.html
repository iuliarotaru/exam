       </a>
       <p>
           
           This theme is all about bycicles and teamwork.
Firstly, we were introduced to the case and business: Copenhagen Municipality "We Bike" 
and, together with our group members we had to decide upon 2 subjects that we will cover
in our website.
After doing sketches, wireframes, and style tiles, our prototype finally came alive.

   <section class="description" id="storyWithoutWords">
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3F8ABn0OJk&feature=youtu.be"  class="links" target="_blank"><h2> Story Without Words</h2></a>
       
       <p>
           First video assignment was about telling a story and how important the sound is.
Our message was that "Time flies" and we challenged ourselves by making a video
with a clear message, that keeps the listeners attention and with a clear plot and progression.
          
       </p>

   <section class="description" id="treatment" style="background-color: #252424;">
    <a href="documents/Treatment-02.01.05.pdf" class="links" target="_blank"><h2>Treatment</h2></a>
       <p>
           Getting back to our xd assignment, we had to work on the actual website and video,
so the Treament was a good way to keep us organised and to have the idea clear in mind.

   <section class="description" id="storyboard">
       <a href="documents/2storyboard.pdf" class="links" target="_blank"><h2>Storyboard</h2></a>
       <p>
           We were not aloud to go out and film the video until we had the storyboard ready
and that made us work like professionals that do not waste time and have everything put in order.

   <section class="description" id="documentation">
      <a href="documents/Documentation.pdf" class="links" target="_blank"><h2>Documentation</h2></a>
      
      <p>
          Another important thing that this theme taught us was that every step in a process
needs to be documented and explained.

       <p>
           Coding was finally ready, video was ready, so that was our work result.
